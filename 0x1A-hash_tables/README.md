In this Project, the *Hash Table* Algorithm has been implemented using C.

- The project implements the chaining method in tackling collision.

- The chains are made up of nodes which are stored in the Hash table

- All function prototypes have been included in the header file "hash_tables.h

- In addition theC programs are betty compliant

- It is important to mention that Daniel J. Bernstein hash function algorithm for cretaing
indexes on the hash table was adopted in this project.
